# Automated-PDF-Extraction-and-Summarization-Using-Natural-Language-Processing

## Project Overview
#### This project, Automated PDF Extraction and Summarization Using NLP, is designed to streamline the extraction and summarization of key information from PDF documents. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to efficiently extract, clean, and analyze text from PDFs. The key focus is on retrieving invoice data, performing text summarization, and analyzing word frequencies, offering a robust solution for managing document-heavy workflows.

## Key Features:
* PDF Text Extraction: Uses libraries like pdfplumber and textract to extract text from PDF documents.
* Invoice Data Retrieval: Extracts invoice-related data such as amounts, dates, and vendors.
* Text Summarization: Provides concise summaries of document content.
* Word Frequency Analysis: Generates word clouds and statistics on the most frequently occurring terms.
* Data Visualization: Produces visual representations of text analytics, such as word clouds and frequency distributions.
  
## The following libraries are essential for running this project:

* textract: For extracting text from PDF documents.
* pdfplumber: An alternative library for PDF text extraction.
* spacy: For NLP tasks such as named entity recognition.
* tensorflow and keras: Required for using machine learning models in NLP.
* matplotlib and wordcloud: For visualizing text data and generating word clouds.
* pdfminer.six: Used for low-level PDF processing and text extraction.

## Future Improvements
* Demographic Data Integration: Enhance the analysis by integrating demographic data for deeper insights.
* Advanced Statistical Analysis: Incorporate more sophisticated statistical models to analyze trends across multiple documents.
* Real-time PDF Processing: Develop a real-time processing pipeline for incoming PDF files.
